Helps Bumby Wool customers to visualize their custom wool clothing

## How to Use
### Color management
The colors are controled by a JSON file called `colors.json` in the root folder of the project. In the `colors.json` file there is an array of color objects. Each color object looks like this:
```
{ "name": "Hops", "patternId": {"fill": "#007258"} }
```
> Each color object in the array will be followed by a `,` at the end of the line **except** for the very last color at the end of the array
