cd c:\\WhereIClonedTheRepo\builder\
```
> If you've opened the project with VS Code you can use `ctrl` + ` to open the terminal to the project directory

Then run:
```
npm start
```
This will server all the files in the repo as static files. You can view the main application page at [http://localhost:3000/builder/index.html](http://localhost:3000/builder/index.html)
